# BirthdayBuddy :birthday:
# What does this app?
This is a simple, material design orientated app to handle all your birthdays, anniversaries and important yearly dates.
You will be reminded about those dates a couple days before they happen (changeable in settings). You can write notes for every event you add and you can set avatar images for your birthdays. For birthdays and annual events you can specify a birthyear or "start-year" to calculate the age of a person, the weekday of their birthday or the n-th time of their occurrence.
You can also add future one-time events like graduation dates, which are automatically deleted after they took place.
